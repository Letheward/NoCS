## Sequence of Notes

### Interval Cycles

IC`i`: `P = i * d`

`P` is the result **P**itch (Mod 12)  
`i` is the Cycle **i**nterval  
`d` is the Cycle **d**egree

~~~

When `i' = - i` (Mod 12),   
IC`i'`: `N' = i' * d = i * ( - d )`,  
`P = 0` When `d = 12`,  
From `d = 12` and walk back, IC`i'` is IC`i` reversed   

We can see:

Only when `i` is `1`, `11`, `5` or `7`  
The Cycle includes all notes in Chromatic Scale

Because

~~~
12 = 2 * 2 * 3

0  = 0             0
1  = 1             1 
2  = 2             prime factor of 12
3  = 3             prime factor of 12
4  = 2 * 2         factor of 12
5  = -7            5
6  = 2 * 3         factor of 12       
7  = -5            7
8  = -4 = - 2 * 2  - factor of 12       
9  = -3            - prime factor of 12 
10 = -2            - prime factor of 12 
11 = -1            - 1
~~~

Then we get 4 Interval Cycles (IC) to represent Chromatic Scale:

1. IC`1`: Chromatic Scale Itself

2. IC`11`: Chromatic Scale reversed

3. IC`7`: Different Sequence, IC`5` reversed

4. IC`5`: Different Sequence, IC`7` reversed

3 pairs and one ICs to slice Chromatic Scale

1. IC`2` and IC`10`: 6 parts of `2`

2. IC`3` and IC`9`: 4 parts of `3`

3. IC`4` and IC`8`: 3 parts of `4`

4. IC`6`: 2 parts of `6`

Quintal Sequence `4` is the reverse of Quartal Sequence `3`

Sixth Sequence `5` is the reverse of Tertian Sequence `2`

Seventh Sequence `6` is the reverse of Original Sequence `1`
