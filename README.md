Any improvement is welcome, though as of now rewriting obscure drafts and solving structural incoherence have higher priority than minor typo fix, etc.

### Markdown Style

A document should stay roughly under 500 lines.

Try to avoid H4 ("####") and above. If really needed, consider creating a new document.

Avoid extended Markdown features in Favored Standards as possible.

Avoid Pictures, Markdown Tables and use "~~~" and monospaced ASCII characters to draw them. (For easier editing, offline reading and compatibility)

For large pile of math or logical derivation, also use "~~~" and monospaced ASCII characters.

Conventions:

- ">" Quotes, Hints

- "`" Numbers, Note Names, Variables, Expressions, Equations

- "-", "1." Lists

- "~~~" Code Blocks, Derivations, Graphs, Tables

- "---" Dividing Lines
