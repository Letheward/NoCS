# Basic Math In Chromatic Scale

## Pitch

> The nature of Chromatic Scale **is** the nature of `12`

In 12 Equal Temperament, The Chromatic Scale can be seen as:

`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11`
or
`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 T E`

- A number in that sequence can represent a Pitch Class

~~~
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  
C  C# D  D# E  F  F# G  G# A  A#  B
C  Db D  Eb E  F  Gb G  Ab A  Bb  B
~~~

- Or a Interval relative to a Note (Using any Note as `0`)

> For example, use `E` as `0`

~~~
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  
E  F  F# G  G# A  A# B  C  C#  D  D# 
E  F  Gb G  Ab A  Bb B  C  Db  D  Eb 
~~~

- 12 base number can be use to represent Absolute Pitch or Interval

~~~
C4: 40
Ab5: 58
B3: 3E
F#10: T6

D#7 - Gb3 = 73 - 36 = 39 (base 12) = 45 (base 10)
Bb5 - E6 = 5T - 64 = -6

reference = A4 = 440Hz = 49
C4 - A4 = 40 - 49 = -9
B5 - A4 = 5E - 49 = 12 (base 12) = 14 (base 10)
~~~

Naming Notes with letters is confusing and hard to calculate  
So we **won't using traditional note names** in analyzing

Instead we using **Mod 12** and **Base 12** Numbers

By default `C = 0` (Mod 12) and `C0 = 00` (Base 12)  

This study is in 12ET  
After Transposing, everything will sound similar  
So Mod 12 and Base 12 in relative sense is also helpful  
When doing this we may add `Note = 0` (Mod 12) and `Note = 00` (Base 12) e.g. `E = 0`

When analysing a particular Scale or Chord,  
we often ignore the absolute Pitch of Notes in them  
By default `Root Note = 0` (Mod 12) and `Lowest Root Note = 00` (Base 12)

## Mod 7

~~~
0 1 2 3 4 5 6

0 2 4 6 1 3 5

0 3 6 2 5 1 4

0 4 1 5 2 6 3

0 5 3 1 6 4 2

0 6 5 4 3 2 1

> Quintal Sequence `4` is the reverse of Quartal Sequence `3`

> Sixth Sequence `5` is the reverse of Tertian Sequence `2`

> Seventh Sequence `6` is the reverse of Original Sequence `1`

## Interval Cycles

> `N = i * d`

`N` is the result **N**ote  
`i` is the Cycle **i**nterval  
`d` is the Cycle **d**egree

> When `i = - x`  
> Cycle `N' = x * d = i * ( - d )`  
> Cycle `N' = x * d` is Cycle `N = i * d` reversed

We can see:
> Only when `i` is `1`, `11`, `5` or `7`  
> The Cycle includes all notes in Chromatic Scale

> Because

12 = 2 * 2 * 3

0  = 0             0
1  = 1             1 
2  = 2             prime factor of 12
3  = 3             prime factor of 12
4  = 2 * 2         factor of 12
5  = -7            5
6  = 2 * 3         factor of 12       
7  = -5            7
8  = -4 = - 2 * 2  - factor of 12       
9  = -3            - prime factor of 12 
10 = -2            - prime factor of 12 
11 = -1            - 1
~~~

Then we get 4 Interval Cycles (IC) to represent Chromatic Scale:

1. IC`1`: Chromatic Scale Itself

2. IC`11`: Chromatic Scale reversed

3. IC`7`: Different Sequence, IC`5` reversed

4. IC`5`: Different Sequence, IC`7` reversed

3 pairs and one ICs to slice Chromatic Scale

1. IC`2` and IC`10`: 6 parts of `2`

2. IC`3` and IC`9`: 4 parts of `3`

3. IC`4` and IC`8`: 3 parts of `4`

4. IC`6`: 2 parts of `6`

> Why mid-points of two Interval Cycles are also the mid-point of Chromatic Scale

> Tritone: `12 / 2 = 6`  

~~~
( 7 * 12 ) / 2 = ( 6 + 1 ) * 12 / 2

( 5 * 12 ) / 2 = ( 6 - 1 ) * 12 / 2

6 * 12 / 2 = 3 * 12

1 * 12 / 2 = 12 - ( 1 * 12 / 2 ) = 6

> Why Black Keys Form Pentatonic

Start from `F`

`0 7 2 9 4 11 6` is Lydian, and `F` Lydian have all the white keys  
The rest is black keys

> `7 * 7 = 1`

~~~
7 * 7  = 7 * (7 + 0) = 7 * 7 + 7 * 0 = 7 * 0 + 1 = 0 + 1
7 * 8  = 7 * (7 + 1) = 7 * 7 + 7 * 1 = 7 * 1 + 1 = 7 + 1
7 * 9  = 7 * (7 + 2) = 7 * 7 + 7 * 2 = 7 * 2 + 1 = 2 + 1
7 * 10 = 7 * (7 + 3) = 7 * 7 + 7 * 3 = 7 * 3 + 1 = 9 + 1
7 * 11 = 7 * (7 + 4) = 7 * 7 + 7 * 4 = 7 * 4 + 1 = 4 + 1
~~~

`0 7 2 9 4` is Major Pentatonic
