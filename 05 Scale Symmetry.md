# Scale Symmetry

## Mirror Scale

> Axis Symmetry

Tritone Axis is the line between Scale Root Note and Tritone

- Any Pair of Mirror Scales have a Tritone Axis

Lydian:  0 2 4 6 7 9 11
Locrian: 0 1 3 5 6 8 10

~~~
0 + 7 = 7
0 - 7 = 5
6 + ( 6 - 7 ) = 5
~~~

## Neutral Scale

Neutral Scale's Mirror Scale is Itself

- Dorian: `0 2 3 5 7 9 10`

- Mixolydian b6: `0 2 4 5 7 8 10`

~~~
0 3 4 6 8 9

0 2 3 6 9 10

0 2 4 6 8 10

0 2 5 7 10

0 3 5 7 9
~~~

`6` is the mirror point

Neutral Scale's PI is always `0`, PR `= 1:1`


## Dark Scale

Notes missing from the scale

`0 2 4 6 7 9 11`, `1 3 5 8 10`

### Grey Scale

> Rotation Symmetry, Dark Scale = Itself

`0 2 3 5 7 10`, `6 8 9 11 1 4` (Touhou Scale)
